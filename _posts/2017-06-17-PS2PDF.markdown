One of the most useful tools is learning how to use Python with basic commands you'd normally use at your terminal.  When I use [XSPEC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/) for spectral modeling, it saves plots nicely in postscript.  However, in many cases they are not easily read by other programs.  You can convert them into a pdf file by using the `ghostscript` converter.  See the website [here](https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/current/Use.htm#Invoking).
At the terminal (I have a Mac), the command is:

{% highlight ruby %}
ps2pdf filename.ps
{% endhighlight %} 
 
where `filename.ps` is the postscript file and the output will be `filename.pdf`.  No resolution has been lost and it appears flawless.

{% highlight ruby %}
import os, glob

burst       = 'bn090328401'
method      = 'PYXSPEC'
det         = 'L'
detdir      = ('GBMwLAT' if 'L' in det else 'GBM')
direc       = '/Users/KimiZ/Python/Github/%s/images/%s/'%(burst, method)
os.chdir(direc) 

AllFiles = glob.glob('*.ps')

for f in AllFiles:
    os.system('ps2pdf %s'%f)
    
{% endhighlight %}    

There are other utility scripts besides ps2pdf, including pdf2ps, ps2epsi, pdf2dsc, ps2ascii, ps2ps, and ps2ps2. 

There are also other ways to convert postscript files to pdf.  When searching for a solution in Python, I came across a website that used the terminal command `convert`, but the resolution came out terrible for me.
{% highlight ruby %}
convert filename.ps filename.pdf
{% endhighlight %} 
I found this method online and [here they show you how to do it in Python].
