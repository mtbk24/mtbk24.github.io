[Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/)

[Frequentism and Bayesianism IV: How to be a Bayesian in Python, by Jake VanderPlas](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/14/frequentism-and-bayesianism-4-bayesian-in-python/)

[Class Inheritance Explained best by Jess Hamrick](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2011/05/18/an-introduction-to-classes-and-inheritance-in-python/)
